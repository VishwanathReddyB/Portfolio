## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 Autonomous Garbage Collection Bot
Designed and developed an AI-driven robotic system for efficient waste collection and sorting. Utilized OpenCV for real-time object detection and classification, enabling the bot to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable materials. Integrated ESP32 microcontroller for motor control and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance. The system autonomously navigates through designated areas, identifies waste objects, and sorts them into appropriate bins.

**Key Technologies**: OpenCV, ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensors, Python

### 🔹 ESP32 NES Gaming Console
Built a retro gaming console powered by the ESP32 microcontroller. Implemented classic NES game emulation using Arduino libraries and custom firmware. Designed a compact hardware interface with responsive buttons and a display module for an immersive gaming experience. Optimized the system for low-latency input handling and smooth graphics rendering.

**Key Technologies**: ESP32, Arduino IDE, C++, OLED Display

### 🔹 Space Rover with Object Detection
Engineered a rover with autonomous navigation and object detection capabilities. Leveraged mono vision and two ultrasonic sensors for real-time environment mapping and path planning. Integrated object detection algorithms to identify and avoid obstacles. The rover successfully navigates rough terrains and adapts to dynamic environments.

**Key Technologies**: ESP32, OpenCV, Mono Vision, Ultrasonic Sensors, Python

### 🔹 Autonomous Rover Navigation
Developed an autonomous rover based on ESP32-CAM for real-time object detection and path planning. Utilized the ESP32-CAM module for capturing live video feeds and implemented computer vision algorithms for obstacle detection. Designed an efficient motor control system for smooth navigation in indoor and outdoor environments.

**Key Technologies**: ESP32-CAM, OpenCV, Python, Motor Control

### 🔹 Drone Navigation & Mapping
Contributed to the eYRC 2024-25 team, focusing on autonomous drone navigation and mapping. Implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms for accurate path planning and environmental mapping. Integrated sensor fusion techniques using IMU and GPS data for stable flight control and precise localization.

**Key Technologies**: Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), OpenCV, IMU Sensors, GPS
